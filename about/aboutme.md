# About me

This website is commercial free. This website does not collect data about you - other than that collected by github pages.

I am maintaing this website to lobby for a better internet and cloud services in the hope that you will find useful information that helps to educate you about alternatives to the current business models that drive the internet.

I am a computer scientist and work for a major IT corporation. The views on this page are my private views.

I do not take money for maintaining this page. I will not accept money from anyone for specific content on the page.

In case this site becomes so popular that I am invited to present about the ideas I will accept a refund of my travel expenses and in some cases of my time spent in preparing and presenting about the ideas I present on this page.
