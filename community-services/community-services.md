## Wikipedia, a free encyclopedia curated by the community

At (Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia] you can find a free encyclopedia that is free from advertisements and does not sell your data to third parties. The articles are written, reviewed and improved by the community for free. The goal is that everyone of us can contribute high quality content.

This is probably the best example for Choice 4 in the Fair Cloud Manifesto: free services curated and provided by us, the community.
