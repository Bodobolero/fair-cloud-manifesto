# Services **financed by advertisements**

In this category we provide examples of services that seem to be "free" but are collecting data about you and selling that data - thus you become the product

## Google maps

At https://www.google.com/maps Google provides a navigation and location service for "free".
However by default the app collects data about your location history and uses that data to personalize ads on its own and other web pages.
